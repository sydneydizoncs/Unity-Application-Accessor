# Unity-Application-Accessor
With this script implemented into a Unity Project, you will be able to open applications from directly within Unity without having to go through the trouble of switching tabs or searching through your desktop. It makes testing games in Unity more efficient, as you can launch a certain file within a program without having to boot the program up first and then opening it the file up inside the program.
